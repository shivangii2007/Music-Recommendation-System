# Music-Recommendation-System

The goal of this project is to enhance user experience by providing personalized music recommendations that align with their tastes.

Implemented a content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation systems for song recommendations.
It is an unsupervised learning model which analyses playlists and gives recommendations.
We created this project to see if we can actually understand the musical patterns of a listener with their playlist as source and what factors are really useful in determining the taste and interest of the listener.


This project is aimed upon building a music recommendation system that gives the user recommendations on music based on his music taste by analysing his/her previously heard music and playlist. This project is done in two ways, using 'User - to - User Recommendation' and 'Item - to - Item Recommendation'. KNN, XGB, Cosine Similarities etc are being used along with 'Surprise' module to compute the similarity between recommendations and user's already existing playlist for evaluation.

For deployment, Streamlit and Pickel are being used.
